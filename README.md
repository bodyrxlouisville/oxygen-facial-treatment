# oxygen-facial-treatment
Have you experienced the oxygen facial treatment? It's one of my top recommendations! This facial yields a radiant glow and effectively locks in moisture. It's ideal for this time of year and leaves your skin with a luminous complexion!
Add atoxelene to ANY oxygen therapy treatment
Rejuvenate – this is recommended for all skin types. Helps with dehydrated/dull skin, premature aging, and firming.
Opulence – this is recommended for textured, sun damaged skin. Helps with brightening the appearance of uneven skin tones, tightening, and softening fine lines/wrinkles.

This helps target specific areas such as expression lines, around the eyes, lips, and forehead to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
